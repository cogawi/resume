# RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

## UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, Seattle, WA **2020-  Present**

### Student Researcher in the Meza Research Group

### Composites Research Project

## KATERRA, Seattle, WA **2019-2020**

### Manufactured Assemblies Design Engineer

- Designed building components to be built in a prefabrication factory and installed on a construction site. Integrated structural, electrical, plumbing and finish components for easy installation.
- Developed a bathroom kit to provide detailed BOMs and drawings for factory assembly and job site installation.
- Created automated model, drawing, and CNC templates for steel wall panels using Catia 3DExperience.
- Built prototypes of manufactured building components to test part and assembly sizing, and to confirm tolerances.

&nbsp;

## SAFRAN AEROSYSTEMS, Everett, WA **2015-2019**

### Design and Integration Engineer

Responsible for structural, mechanical, and fluid system designs; working on detail designs as well as integration of parts and assemblies into the aircraft with minimal interface information. Collaborated across multiple site in different countries, and coordinated extensively with customer representatives throughout design, testing, and production.

- Conducted root cause analysis of failed valves. Disassembled valve to investigate the cause, and retested to confirm the problem.
- Redesigned the 737 airstair to include new safety features and increase height. From a high level work statement, investigated the extent of change required, and found solutions to various problems discovered during development and testing.
- Integrated 737 airstair design into the aircraft structure, and built a complete CATIA assembly and kinematic model to ensure proper fit and operation.
- Designed an aircraft galley fluid waste disposal system, producing designs for structural support of valves, a tank, sensors, and electrical components, all designed to fit into a small space in an aircraft galley.

## BOEING COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES, Everett, WA **2006 – 2012, 2014**

### Structural Design Engineer

Took ownership of part concepts and designs, collaboration with stress analysts, manufacturing engineering, suppliers, and other design groups. Worked on initial design through production on the 747-8 and 767 tanker, on the wing, tail, and body.

- Designed aluminum and composite parts, and assemblies large and small. Optimized parts for weight and cost without compromising on strength.
- Coordinated with Boeing and supplier production facilities from concept to production, to ensure parts are easy to manufacture and assemble, making visits as parts were being produced to ensure quality production.
- Integrated electrical wiring, mechanical systems and fluid systems into the structural design, working closely with members of other teams to provide the best design.
- Redesigned a critical structural member in the 747 wing, replacing an assembly with hundreds of parts with a single part, in order to reduce weight and assembly time.
- Corrected production problems looking through 35 years of drawings and seeing completed parts on the airplane in the factory.

&nbsp;

## KVICHAK MARINE INDUSTRIES, Seattle, WA **2012 – 2014**

### Project Engineer

Developed structure and mechanical system designs for aluminum hulled boats. Worked from concept through production providing design and analysis.

- Completed concept, design, and finite element analysis to meet customer requirements.
- Modeled structure and fluid systems parts and assemblies in SolidWorks and produced drawings for manufacturing.
