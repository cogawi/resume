# MECHANICAL DESIGN ENGINEER

Mechanical engineer with the heart of an inventor, a problem solver with the ability to design and build products. Experienced in bringing products from concept through production, with feedback from the customer and supplier throughout the process.

- 10 years of mechanical and structural design experience, working on big picture large assemblies, as well as minute details, and defining designs with 2D drawings and 3D models.
- Experienced in working with internal and external suppliers, designing for production lines as well as custom products.
- Accustomed to working in teams of different disciplines, including manufacturing engineers, stress analysts and electrical systems designers, whose input is required to complete the job.

# EXPERIENCE

## ZODIAC WASTE AND WATER AERO SYSTEMS, Everett, WA **2015-Present**

### Design and Integration Engineer

Worked on designing a complete update to the 737 airstair for the 737 MAX, and created aircraft fluid system installation and detail drawings.

- Developed design solutions to allow updating the 737 airstair to include new safety features and an extra step within the same envelope. From a high level work statement, investigated the extent of change required, and found solutions to various problems discovered during development.
- Integrated 737 airstair design into the aircraft structure, and built a complete assembly and kinematic model to ensure proper fit and operation.
- Acted as primary designer and coordinated with coworkers across many locations in different countries to drive the project to completion. Created company standards for mechanical, fluid, and HVAC system design, and standard fasteners and fittings, reducing labor costs and resource utilization for future designs.

## BOEING COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES, Everett, WA **2006 – 2012, 2014**

### Structural Design Engineer

Responsible for part concepts and designs, collaboration with stress analysts, manufacturing engineering, suppliers, and other design groups. Worked on initial design through production on the 747-8 and 767 tanker, on the wing, tail, and body.

- Designed aluminum and composite parts, and assemblies large and small. Optimized parts for weight and cost without compromising on strength.
- Used a 3D printer to produce a test tool for the 747 wing panels, to ensure that the wing would be assembled without problems.
- Coordinated with Boeing and supplier production facilities from concept to production, to ensure parts are easy to manufacture and assemble, making visits as parts were being produced to ensure quality production.
- Integrated electrical wiring, mechanical systems and fluid systems into the structural design, working closely with members of other teams to provide the best design.
- Redesigned a critical structural member in the 747 wing, replacing an assembly with hundreds of parts with a single part, in order to reduce weight and assembly time.
- Corrected production problems looking through 35 years of drawings and seeing completed parts on the airplane in the factory.
- Performed preliminary analysis on parts to confirm optimum design for reduced weight.

## KVICHAK MARINE INDUSTRIES, Seattle, WA **2012 – 2014**

### Project Engineer

Developed structure and mechanical system designs for aluminum hulled boats. Worked from concept through production providing design and analysis.

- Completed concept, design, and finite element analysis to meet customer requirements. Worked in SolidWorks to model detail parts and assemblies.
- Designed the structure and fluid systems on a 75’ pilot boat.
- Created a design for a new engine mount on an Army prototype boat on a rapid schedule.

# OTHER ACTIVITIES & SKILLS

- Experienced in SolidWorks (Certified SolidWorks Professional), CATIA V5 (7 years daily use), and AutoCAD (2 years).
- Design of sheet metal, extruded, machined plate, and composite parts, small and large assemblies. 3D and 2D assembly and detail part definition. Understanding of reasonable tolerances, and how to apply GD&T.
- Used machine tools and hand tools to build my own designs out of wood and metal. Built parts for a Formula SAE drivetrain, and my own kitchen cabinets.
- Proficient in Mandarin Chinese and Spanish.
